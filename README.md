# Deep Learning From Scratch 🧠💡

Welcome to "Deep Learning From Scratch"! This repository is dedicated to building deep learning models and architectures entirely from scratch, without relying on popular frameworks or even basic libraries like `numpy` and `pandas`. The primary goal is to understand the underlying algorithms at their most fundamental level.

## 🌟 **Highlights**:
- **No Shortcuts**: Every single algorithm and function is written from the ground up.
- **Educational Focus**: Aimed at those wishing to delve deep into the intricacies of deep learning, bypassing the abstractions provided by libraries.
- **Modular Code**: Each algorithm or model is contained in its folder with an example script for easy understanding.

## 📁 **Repository Structure**:
- **[Perceptron](./Perceptron/)**: Contains the basic perceptron algorithm and a [Perceptron Example](./Perceptron/perceptron_example.py).
- **More to come**: As we progress, we'll be adding Multi-Layer Perceptrons, CNNs, RNNs, and more.

## 🛤️ [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md):
We have an exciting journey ahead! Check out our [ROADMAP](./ROADMAP.md) to see the progression and milestones we aim to achieve.
